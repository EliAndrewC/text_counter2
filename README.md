# text_counter2
A text counter for Insight Data Engineering

Just run "run.sh" in bash. It will call "wordcount_and_median.py"
which will read all of the text files in the "wc_input" folder.
Then it will output the word count to the "wc_result.txt" file
and the running median to the "med_result.txt" file in the "wc_output" folder.
